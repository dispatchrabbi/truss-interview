# truss-interview

My solution to Truss's engineering interview challenge.

## Installing

First, clone the repo:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/dispatchrabbi/truss-interview.git
```

Then install dependencies:

```sh
$ cd truss-interview
$ npm install
```

## Running

This tool takes an input CSV on stdin and outputs its results to stdout. You can use it like this:

```sh
$ normalizer.js < input.csv > output.csv
```
